THE WAY

I came across calendar mazes structures using the sun to collect data. I also came across “Block Universe Theory” with a “everything is already written” determinism and scientists say that you can only make sens of time thfough change. I will collect data through interviews to understand what or who people would chose to guide them. One could think of a maze-calendar with indications coming not from the sun but from things or persons of our present or past to help us find the way.
