THE WAY

I came across calendar mazes structures using the sun to collect data. I also came across “Block Universe Theory” with a “everything is already written” determinism and physicists takes on time as successive images constantly changing. A labyrinth is a complicated irregular network of passages or paths in which it is difficult to find its way. This is for me a metaphor about life. Sometimes you’d want somebody or something to give you guidance or reassure you. One could think of a maze-calendar with indications coming not from the sun but from things or persons of our present or past to help us find the way.
