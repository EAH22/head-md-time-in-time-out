# Motionless objects can tell a story

I took before-afters pics, iPhone lives, long exposures and also timelapses. I showed my interviewees the pic below and asked if they’d tell if time was passing there. I got 3 different temporalities in the answers : 
* For some the image is fixed in time and you can’t guess its continuity (is it lit ?) or its past (when was it lit?). 
* For others it is easy to see a logical continuity (it will burn). 
* At last, some said you could clearly tell from this image alone that there is a beginning, a present and an end to this object.

From those observations I imagine a world where everything is frozen in time and you can only see its “objects” temporality when you get close to them.
