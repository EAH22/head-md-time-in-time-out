Coming Back

We defined my scope as being composed of two elements : worlds whose characteristics were based on words describing the “bicycle guy image” and the temporalities coming from the “cigarette image”. As I wrote the storyline, connecting the worlds and having a simple intention (finding the keys), I realized my story might miss the time element and highlighting too much the amnesic part. The plan was to write a retroactive narration so I integrated the temporality angle into the coma part which came from watching “The Bear” serie and ended up connecting dots in my story.
