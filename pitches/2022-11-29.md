The Keys

You play a character that never talks. This person lost its keys and goes on an adventure to find them back. You go through different worlds all intertwined. In each world you find an afrtefact you'll use to get to the next world. All this in the hope of finding your keys. Each world has its own temporality and characteristics. The twine I am showing today is a gauntlet because I want tp have a solid base before I build differen paths and create agency, to end up having a branch & bottleneck. It is also a retroactive narration in which you'll find out that the characters isn't really looking for it's keys and that it is deeper than this. I still have to write it though.
