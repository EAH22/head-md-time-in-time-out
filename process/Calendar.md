## intro 
While watching anime last night, there was a scene where a kid was talking about his deceased brother. At one point he said that he died "Meiji Year 27, September 17th". I wondered what it meant and decided to investigate.

## Explaination
First of all, today's year is 2022 right ? well for the japanese we are actually in the Reiwa era year 4 or 'R4'. While Japan adopted the gregorian calendar in the 19th century, this system of designating years as era names based on he reign of the emperors is still a current practice and runs along the gregorian calendar we are used to. A ?'geng≈ç' or era name is starts the day an emperor/empress ascends to the throne and ends the day he/she dies. The era names are chosen by court officials and aren't based on the empereor/empress names.

## Outputs
These observations on the nature of japanese era names and its calendar system highlighted the fact that there are numerous different calendars in the world based on lunar, solar and sometines both cycles. It could be interesting to investigate it more to understand the diffferences and how different ancient civilizations or modern era cultures relate to time fragmentations.
